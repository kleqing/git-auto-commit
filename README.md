[![🃏 Autocommit workflow](https://github.com/kleqing/git-auto-commit/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg?event=check_run)](https://github.com/kleqing/git-auto-commit/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

## 📋 What is this repository about? 📋

This repository is automated with a **GitHub Action** that is programmed to perform a unique task:

Every 1 hour, this GitHub Action springs into action. It performs a simple yet effective operation: it updates this README file.

## 🔄 What does the update involve? 🔄

During each update, a new line of text is appended at the end of this file. This line is a timestamp, marking the date and time at which the update was made. And to add a touch of fun to each update, a random emoji is included.

But that's not all! The same random emoji is also included in the commit message for that update.

## ⏳ How long will this continue? ⏳

This GitHub Action is set to continue its daily tasks until the end of the year 2026. (Or I can stop it soonẻ if I got A rank in my github stat💀)
